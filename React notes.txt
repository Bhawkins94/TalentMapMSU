React
A library for Javascript used to generate UI for single webpage applications.
Reach keeps a virtual Documnet Object Model (DOM) which it uses to make only the neccessary updates to a page
Using ECMAScript 6 (ES6), we can work with a special form of Javascript function called classes, and use let and const to create variables
	Classes have constructors, methods, children, parents
	"let" creates variables with a block scope
	"const" creates constants
ReactDOM.render allows React to render HTML script
	ReactDOM.render(variableWithHTML, document.getElementById('id in HTML doc'));
Javascript XML (JSX) converts HTML tags into React elements
Components are functions which return HTML elements
	Class components
	Function components
Props (properties) act like arguments to Javascript functions and HTML attributes
	this.props.variable
